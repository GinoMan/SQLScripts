# SQLScripts

This is a repository for miscelaneous SQL Scripts that I wrote as needed. Any proprietary information in the scripts has been obfuscated in such a way that the information could never be recovered but that conveys the information in the working script.

## AddSelfToKioskDB.sql

This script was written so that I could quickly add myself to the kiosks I was tasked with testing at a previous job. The kiosk allowed for logins using a fingerprint reader. Adding in all of the information took several minutes, especially since each finger recorded for the fingerprint reader needed to be recorded several times to get a reliable print for identity verification. By using the script I wrote myself, I was able to bypass that process in a matter of seconds and get to testing much quicker.
